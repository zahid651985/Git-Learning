    <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
    <p>HTML: We will spend the first chapter
        looking at how HTML is used to
        create web pages. You will see
        that you start by writing down
        the words you want to appear
        on your page. You then add tags
        or elements to the words so
        that the browser knows what is
        a heading, where a paragraph
        begins and ends, and so on.</p>

        <p>CSS: We start this section with a
            chapter that explains how CSS
            uses rules to enable you to
            control the styling and layout
            of web pages.</p>

            <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
            <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
                the page. And if the page is a long one it might
                be split up into several sub-headings.</p>

                <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
                <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
                    you follow the structure of what is being written.
                    There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
                    headings).</p>

                    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
                    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
